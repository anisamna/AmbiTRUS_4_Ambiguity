# AmbiTRUS_4_Ambiguity

# Abstract:
Ambiguity is a well-known issue in natural language-based requirements. Existing frameworks often address this problem as a singular issue rather than acknowledging its complexity. Various studies reveal that ambiguity in user stories can manifest differently depending on the linguistic levels at which it occurs. 
This study aims to encapsulate these diverse manifestations of ambiguity in user stories by constructing a structured matrix called the ambiguity analysis framework (AmbiTRUS). The proposed quality criteria are then compared with three established user story quality framework: the Quality User Story (QUS) framework, the Agile Requirements Verification framework and INVEST, to evaluate the adherence of the AmbiTRUS to the existing frameworks. 
To assess the potential effectiveness of the AmbiTRUS, a controlled experiment was conducted with students majoring in IT and Business, who represent the real users of the framework. While the experiments did not demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in identifying ambiguity in user stories, the findings indicate potential usability. The study highlights the necessity for further refinement of the AmbiTRUS quality criteria, along with adjustment towards a tool-supported method to enhance its practical application.  

# Keywords: 
Requirements Quality Framework, User Stories, Ambiguity, Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) 

# Highlights:
•	The AmbiTRUS framework is developed based on the diverse manifestations of ambiguity in user stories 

•	The quality criteria of the AmbiTRUS framework are reviewed using the established user story quality frameworks

•	The controlled experiment did not find significant difference in precision and recall between the participants who had access to the AmbiTRUS framework and those who did not

•	The experiment found a significant difference in the perceived usefulness of the AmbiTRUS framework, with participants who had access to the framework rating it higher in usefulness compared to those who did not

•	The study highlights the necessity for additional improvements in quality criteria and addaptations to a tool-supported method to enhance both the effectiveness and user-friendliness of the framework
